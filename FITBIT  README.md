# 📊 Fitbit Health Tracker Data Analysis

This project explores data from Fitbit users to uncover patterns between **daily activity**, **sleep**, and **heart rate** and their connection to health goals.

---

## 🔍 Research Questions & Insights

1. **Do users who take more steps burn more calories?**  
   ✔️ Yes — we found a strong positive correlation between step count and calories burned.

2. **How does sleep affect daily activity levels?**  
   ✔️ Users with longer sleep durations tended to be more active the next day.

3. **What is the average heart rate trend across days?**  
   ✔️ Weekdays showed slightly higher resting heart rates compared to weekends.

4. **Are users meeting health benchmarks (e.g., 10,000 steps/day)?**  
   ✔️ Only 25% of users met this goal consistently.
